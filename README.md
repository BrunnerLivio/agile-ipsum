## About

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

In order to adjust the *Lorem Ipsum* to todays standart, the **Agile Ipsum** was born. Instead of
latin-looking words, the Agile Ipsum generates placeholder texts with **agile buzzwords**.

## What Does this Repository Contain?

This repository contains a website, built with a static site generator called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The agile words are being stored in the [`words.txt`](https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/agile-ipsum/blob/master/words.txt) file, which are being read while building the website.

In addition to this, it also contains:

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - our Code of Conduct
